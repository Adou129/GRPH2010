				<strong><p style="margin:30px;color: white; font-size:30px ; line-height: 50px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;The word pīnyīn (拼音) in Chinese literally means "spell-sounds. It is the most commonly used system for transcribing or spelling Chinese speech. Pinyin also contains 26 letters of the alphabet, but they have their own unique pronunciation and can be combined together to form new pronunciations.
Pinyin is divided into vowels and rhymes, and the rhymes are added to the vowels to form the complete pinyin. (eg:ba, pa, mi) Again each pinyin has four different tones.
Learning Pinyin is one of the best ways to get in touch with Chinese. This is because it is similar to the English alphabet.</p></strong>

				<strong><p style="margin:30px;color: white; font-size:30px; line-height: 50px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;The pinyin system was developed in the 1950s by a group of Chinese linguists, including Zhou Youguang, and was based on an earlier form of romanization of Chinese. Mao initially considered Latinizing written Chinese, but during his first official visit to the Soviet Union in 1949, Joseph Stalin convinced him to retain the existing writing system. In 1955, when the Chinese Ministry of Education established the Chinese Character Reform Committee, Premier Zhou Enlai assigned Zhou Youguang to develop a new pinyin system. It was published by the Chinese government in 1958.</p></strong>
